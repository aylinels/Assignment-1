          <p><strong>caught -- the bubble</strong></p>
          <p>in the&nbsp;<em>spirit</em>&nbsp;level,</p>
          <p>a creature divided;</p>
          <p>and the compass needle</p>
          <p>wobbling and wavering,</p>
          <p>undecided.</p>
    <p>Freed -- the <br>broken--</p>
    <h5>thermometer's mercury</h5>
    <h2>running away;</h2>
    <h6>and the rainbow-bird</h6>
    <h8>from the narrow bevel</h8>
    <h4>of the empty mirror,</h4>
    <h3>flying wherever</h3>
    <h1>it feels like, gay!</h1>
